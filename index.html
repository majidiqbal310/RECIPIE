    Beef Keema with Yogurt (Ground Beef)
This rich beef keema gets its creamy texture and slight tartness from being cooked with yogurt instead of tomatoes. It's a great recipe for keema lovers who are looking to switch up their recipe rotation.

<h1>EQUIPMENT</h1>
<p>1 Heavy bottom pot</p>

<h1>INGREDIENTS</h1>
<ol>
<li>⅓ cup neutral oil</li>
<li>1 bay leaf</li>
<li>1 black cardamom</li>
<li>4 cloves</li>
<li>½ inch cinnamon stick</li>
<li>1 large yellow onion thinly sliced in half rings</li>
<li>1 tablespoon ginger and garlic paste</li>
<li>2 to 4 chilies or to taste sliced lengthwise</li>
<li>½ teaspoon turmeric powder</li>
<li>1 teaspoon cumin powder</li>
<li>2 teaspoon coriander powder</li>
<li>1 teaspoon red chili powder</li>
<li>1 pound ground beef</li>
<li>1 ¼ teaspoon salt or to taste</li>
<li>1 cup full-fat yogurt whisked and brought to room temperature</li>
</ol>

<H1>INSTRUCTIONS</H1>
 
<ol>
<li>Heat oil in a heavy bottom pot. Once it begins to shimmer, add whole spices (bay leaf, black cardamom, cloves and cinnamon stick) and fry on medium to medium-low heat for 30 seconds or until fragrant.</li>
<li>Add onions and sauté until evenly brown for 7 to 12 minutes.</li>
<li>Add crushed ginger and garlic and fry for 30 seconds. Take care not to let it burn. Stir in green chilies.</li>
<li>Add ground spices (turmeric, coriander, cumin and red chili powder) fry for 1 minute. Deglaze the pan with a splash of water (1 tablespoon at a time) if and as needed.</li>
<li>Increase heat to medium to medium high, and add ground beef and salt. Crumble with wooden spatula and fry until no longer pink, about 5 minutes.</li>
<li>Add ½ cup room temperature water and bring to a simmer. Lower heat, cover and let the beef cook for 30 minutes. Stir occasionally to make sure it doesn't stick to the bottom of the pan. Once done, remove cover and let it simmer to boil out any excess moisture. Check for salt and adjust as needed.</li>
<li>Fold in yogurt and stir continuously on medium-low heat for about 8 to 10 minutes until the oil begins to separate from the keema and you get the desired texture.</li>
<li>Remove from heat, place in serving platter and garnish with finely chopped cilantro and chilies. Serve with roti or plain basmati rice.</li>
